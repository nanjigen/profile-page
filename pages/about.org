データアナリスト・言語学者

Data Analyst and Linguistics Researcher | Localization Specialist

Location: Tokyo, Japan

Summary:

I am a results-driven professional with a strong background in Data Engineering and Computational Linguistics, based in Tokyo, Japan. My expertise lies in leveraging Python and GCP for data analysis and developing efficient workflows. My passion for solving complex problems in the realm of Linguistics has driven me to explore cutting-edge tools and open-source programs to improve data processing and analysis.

Experience and Skills:

 - Data Engineering and Analysis: Proficient in using Python and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) to tackle diverse datasets and extract valuable insights. I have successfully completed various data-driven projects, including language-related research and second language acquisition analysis.
 - Technical Localization: While I have experience in Japanese to English translation, my primary focus has been on the technical aspects of localization and linguistic quality assurance. I have collaborated with prominent Japanese publishers, contributing to the adaptation and optimization of products for global audiences.
 - Computational Linguistics: With a keen interest in Computational Linguistics, I have developed expertise in applying Space Repetition algorithms and other computational techniques to study language patterns and behavior.
 - Efficient Workflow Development: I utilize Emacs (Doom Emacs distribution) as my primary tool to streamline translation, programming, and data analysis tasks. Leveraging Vim-like modal editing in various applications further enhances my productivity. Additionally, I adopt a literate programming style, similar to Jupyter notebooks, using org-mode for cross-compatibility and seamless collaboration.
 - Research and Open-Source Contribution: I am dedicated to continuous learning in Computer Science and data analysis. During my free time, I contribute to theoretical open-source programs like org-incremental and actively study LISPs and mathematics to deepen my technical knowledge.
