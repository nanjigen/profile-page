The idea of this blog post is to both assist Japanese learners visiting Japan in finding their second-hand book of choice in a book-off, as well as demonstrate my own knowledge of Japan and its literate in my blog for others to see.

- Find some resources on Japanese dewey decimal system

- Have a focus on second-hand book stores (book off etc)
- Maybe include an academic section?
- Have a manga section!
- Video?
- Have a section about getting a library card and taking a book out.

The main method of classification in Japan is the Nippon Decimal Classification system (日本十進分類法)
