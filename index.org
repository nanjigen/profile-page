Alongside my expertise in games and creative writing, I have engaged in honours research within the field of Linguistics, focusing on second language acquisition and the use of Space Repetition algorithms. I leverage my proficiency in Python and Computational Linguistics to analyze linguistic and other data. Currently, I am based in Tokyo, Japan.

Experience and Skills:

    - Tools and Software: Proficient in using Emacs (Doom Emacs distribution) as my primary tool, enabling efficient translation, programming, and analysis workflows. I employ Vim-like modal editing in various applications, enhancing my productivity. Additionally, I leverage org-mode in a literate programming style, similar to Jupyter notebooks, for cross-compatibility.
    - Research and Development: Keen interest in Computer Science and data analysis, dedicating free time to theoretical open-source programs (e.g., org-incremental) and studying LISPs and mathematics.
